1- python coding 
--> given a file in this format
ram
shyaam
suresh
mukesh
dhwani
shekar

--> you need to read this file and print last 3 words read 

soln --> used queue to store last 3 encountred words....and popping(0) from queue if len of queue exceeds 3

--> follow up --> make this dynamic i.e print last k words 
--> f = data.readlines() --> is in memory ... if data is large it will fail and soln
soln --> use with open as file and for line in file:

--> how would you write test autmoated, if file is not there 
soln use patching 

--> how would you make it more testable
soln --> keep with open in different fucntion and segregate logic



OTHER question
--> interview was heavily based on devops , kubernetes, eks , docker file, optimize images, scaling pods in kubernetes 
--> iam vs bucket ploicy , what is pod, how to maange pod better with eks for security 
--> a Pod can contain more than one container, if these containers are relatively tightly coupled.
--> security of container
Best practices
As a developer, you can take a few simple steps to improve the security of your container. This includes:

Choosing the right base image from a trusted source and keeping it small
Using multi-stage builds
Rebuilding images
Scanning images during development
Scanning images during production
