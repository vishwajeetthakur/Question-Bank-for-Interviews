5. Given a URL, design a service that generates a shorter and unique alias for it. When users access a short link, the service should redirect them to the original link. Users should also be able to optionally define the alias for their link (e.g. "https://shorturl/myCustomLink"). If none is provided, the link should be short and pseduorandom hash (not easily guessable). Users should be able to specify the expiration time after which the tiny link no longer functions. If none is provided, links should expire after a standard default timespan. Canvas actions # ffffff Shapes TK Canvas actions 100%
